        <p><i><b>Valorant</b></i> (stylized as <b>VALORANT</b>) is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_Games" target="_blank">Riot Games</a>, for Microsoft Windows. First teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by an official release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike" target="_blank">Counter-Strike</a> series of tactical shooters, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving. </p>

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <hr>
             <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_shooter" target="blank">hero shooter</a> set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives.</p>

            <h4>Unrated</h4>
            <p>
                In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point.
            </p>
            
                <h4>Spike Rush</h4>
            <p>
                In the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win 4 rounds wins the match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which charges twice as fast as in standard games. All players on the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be activated per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every player begins with the same gun. Ultimate point orbs in the standard game are present, as well as multiple different power-up orbs.
            </p>           
            
            <h4>Competitive</h4>
            <p>
                Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system that assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. Players are required to reach level 20 before playing this mode. In July 2020, Riot introduced a "win by two" condition for competitive matches, where instead of playing a single sudden death round at 12-12, teams will alternate playing rounds on attack and defense in overtime until a team claims victory by securing a two-match lead. Each overtime round gives players the same amount of money to purchase guns and abilities, as well as approximately half of their ultimate ability charge.</p>
            
            <h4>Deathmatch </h4>
            <p>
                The Deathmatch mode was introduced on August 5, 2020. 14 players enter a 9-minute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathmatch">free-for-all</a> match and the first person to reach 40 kills or the player who has the most kills when time is up wins the match. Players spawn in with a random agent as well as full shields, and all abilities are disabled during the match which indulges pure gunplay. Green health packs drop on every kill, which reset the player to maximum health, armor, and give an additional 30 bullets to each of their guns.

            <h4>Duelist</h4>
            <p>
                Duelists specialize in attacking and entering a bomb site for the team. Riot's official definition for duelists is "self-sufficient fraggers." Duelists mainly create space for their team while entering onto a site, giving their teammates information, and making entering a site easier. Their abilities tend to consist of flashes which blind enemies, and movement-based abilities that allow for them to cover large distances faster than other agents. This type of ability kit allows for duelists to shine best when they are able to catch players off guard and get impact frags.</p>
            
            <h4>Sentinel</h4>
            <p>
                Sentinels are the defensive line, which specializes in locking down sites and protecting teammates from enemies. Their abilities mainly consist of static 'objects' that are obstacles to the enemies. These objects can give the team valuable information and/or deal damage.

On attack, sentinelss can use their abilities to cut off certain parts of the map or set up 'objects' that can ensure the enemy cannot flank without being noticed.
